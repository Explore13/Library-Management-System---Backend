Perfect 👌 You don’t want snippets, you want the **end-to-end battle plan** — how to structure the project, where each file lives, what to type in terminal, and how the flow connects. No code, only process. Let’s go full **architect mode** 🔥

# 🏗️ Step-by-Step Process to Build a C# OOP Web API (Library Management System)

---

## 1️⃣ Create the Project

1. Install **.NET SDK 8 (or 7)** on your machine.

2. Open terminal and run:

   ```bash
   dotnet new webapi -n LibraryAPI
   cd LibraryAPI
   ```

   * `dotnet new webapi` → sets up a **Kestrel server + minimal controllers**.
   * `-n LibraryAPI` → project folder name.

3. Open the folder in **Visual Studio Code** (or Rider, Visual Studio — your choice).

---

## 2️⃣ Understand the Folder Structure

After running the command, you’ll see:

```
LibraryAPI/
│
├── Controllers/           # API endpoints live here
│   └── WeatherForecastController.cs (default, you can delete it)
│
├── Models/                # Your OOP entities (Book, User, Librarian, etc.)
│
├── Services/              # Business logic (LibraryService, interfaces)
│
├── Program.cs             # Entry point, configures the server
├── appsettings.json       # Config (ports, logging, connection strings later)
├── LibraryAPI.csproj      # Project metadata
```

---

## 3️⃣ Define Your **Models** (OOP Classes)

Inside `Models/` folder, create files:

* `Book.cs` → represents a book entity.
* `User.cs` → represents a user.
* `Librarian.cs` → inherits from `User`.
* (Optional: `BorrowRecord.cs` → to track borrow/return history.)

👉 These are **POCO classes** (Plain Old CLR Objects).
They will have only **properties + methods** → no API/DB logic here.

---

## 4️⃣ Define Your **Interface**

Inside `Services/`, create `ILibraryService.cs`:

* Declares methods for:

  * `ListAvailableBooks()`
  * `SearchBook(title)`
  * `BorrowBook(userId, isbn)`
  * `ReturnBook(userId, isbn)`
  * `AddBook(book)` (optional, for librarian role)

👉 This enforces **abstraction** — different implementations can exist.

---

## 5️⃣ Implement the **Service**

Inside `Services/`, create `LibraryService.cs`:

* Holds **in-memory lists** (`List<Book>`, `List<User>`).
* Implements methods from `ILibraryService`.
* Applies OOP principles:

  * **Encapsulation** → keep raw lists private, expose only via methods.
  * **Polymorphism** → override/implement behaviors differently (user vs librarian).
  * **Inheritance** → `User` vs `Librarian`.

This layer is **business logic only**, no HTTP here.

---

## 6️⃣ Wire Up Dependency Injection

Open `Program.cs`:

* Register `ILibraryService` and `LibraryService`.
  This makes your service available to controllers via **constructor injection**.

---

## 7️⃣ Create Controllers (API Endpoints)

Inside `Controllers/`:

* Delete the default `WeatherForecastController.cs`.
* Create:

  * `BooksController.cs`
  * `UsersController.cs`

### `BooksController`

* Routes:

  * `GET /books` → list all books.
  * `GET /books/search?title=abc` → search book.
  * `POST /books/borrow` → borrow a book.
  * `POST /books/return` → return a book.

### `UsersController`

* Routes:

  * `POST /users` → register user.
  * `GET /users/{id}` → get user info.

👉 Controllers are **thin wrappers**: they just call `LibraryService` methods and return results.

---

## 8️⃣ Run & Test with Postman

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   * Default: `https://localhost:5001`

2. Open Postman → test endpoints:

   * `GET https://localhost:5001/books`
   * `GET https://localhost:5001/books/search?title=Harry Potter`
   * `POST https://localhost:5001/books/borrow` with JSON body:

     ```json
     { "userId": "U1", "isbn": "12345" }
     ```

---

## 9️⃣ Observe Memory Model (while coding)

* When you `new Book()`, the **object goes to heap**.
* The variable reference (`Book b = new Book();`) lives on **stack**, pointing to heap.
* Lists hold **references** to heap objects, not copies.
* When you remove a book from `List<Book>`, but no one else references it → GC eventually reclaims.
* Controllers don’t copy objects → they pass **references** to the service.

---

## 🔟 Optional Enhancements (when you’re comfy)

* Add **custom exceptions** (`BookNotFoundException`).
* Add **middleware** to handle errors uniformly.
* Use **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** in controllers so you don’t leak domain models directly.
* Persist data to **JSON file / SQLite DB** instead of in-memory.
* Add **events/delegates** → e.g., trigger notification when a book is returned.

---

## Final Flow Recap

```
Postman Request
      ↓
   Controller (API Layer)
      ↓ calls
   LibraryService (Business Logic)
      ↓ uses
   Models (OOP Entities)
      ↓
   Returns response back to Postman
```

---

👉 That’s the full structured process, no code, just execution steps.

Do you want me to also break this into a **day-wise roadmap** (like Day 1: project setup, Day 2: models, Day 3: controllers, etc.) so you can practice in focused sprints?
